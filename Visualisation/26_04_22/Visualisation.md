# Visualisation of Knowledge Graph



# Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>

In this visualization, knowledge graphs of clinical trials are represented, by linking clinical trial id to on what Conditions trial is conducted, what type of Interventions are employed during trial and what articles are being cited.

In visualization of knowledge graphs, the Source is the **center node**, which is a **trial link**.

Nodes around the center node(**periphery nodes**) are target nodes, which are **LInks to Conditions, Interventions and Articles**.

**Edges** create links between source and targets. They establish a relationship between two nodes and type relation is labeled on edges. Here, there are three **types of relations ie., Conditions, Interventions and Pubmed articles**.

A trial can be conducted on different conditions and interventions which are defined by the MeSH(Medical Subject Headings) term. So a trial will have one or more conditions and interventions.
